# React & TypeScript Weather App Hackathon

This is a weather app created with React and TypeScript during the week 12 Hackathon day at the School of Code. The app fetches data from an API and displays a list of the different weather conditions of any city (based on user search). This was created after 3 days of learning TypeScript and it really highlighted the benefit of the language for me (specifically around strongly typed languages and reducing errors). 

## Skills

Tools and languages:
- React
- TypeScript
- CSS
